# -Algorithm-Implementation-Technologies

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: <br />
The aim of the excercises is to present techniques, properties, implementations and applications of basic and advanced algorithms and data structures. It will also discuss <br />
(a) issues of creating software environments and libraries that allow easy implementation and experimental evaluation of algorithms and <br />
(b) methodological issues regarding experimental research of algorithms and data structures, as well as regarding the process of converting user requirements into efficient algorithmic solutions and implementations. <br />
As the actual implementation environment, the C++ language is used together with the LEDA, STL and BOOST libraries <br />
